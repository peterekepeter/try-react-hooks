# Try React Hooks

This project is meant as an example of how the same code can be written with hooks.
Check out [AppHooks.js]('./src/AppHooks.js') and [AppClass.js]('./src/AppHooks.js'), 
compare them side by side, see which one you like more. 

I think I'm sticking with hooks... ðŸ˜Š

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
