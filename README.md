# Try React Hooks

This project is meant as an example of how the same code can be written with hooks.
Check out AppHooks.js and AppClass.js, compare them side by side, see which one
you like more. I think I'm sticking with hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
